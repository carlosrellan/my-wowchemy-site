Arte rupestre galega is a simply Shiny and Leaflet web app exploring Galician prehistoric rock art. Users can explore the more than 3.000 rock art sites included in the Direcci√≥n Xeral de Patrimonio Cultural (Xunta de Galicia). Petroglyphs can be selected by type of engraving (cup marks, cup and rings, labyrinths, animals, weapons, crosses, prehistoric varia and historic varia) and municipality. A barplot explores the number and type of engravings within each municipality.
