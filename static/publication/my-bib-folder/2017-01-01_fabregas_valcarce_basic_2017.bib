  abstract = {© Universidad de Salamanca. Ever since first published in 1970, Palazuelo de las Cuevas (Zamora) became known as {"}the variscite source{"} for nw Iberia. Later geological surveys and casual finds have shown this mineral to be much more widespread, including other localities in Zamora, Northern Portugal (Tras-os-Montes), Western León (Bierzo) and Eastern and Southwest Galicia (Ourense and Pontevedra). Still, the evidence of prehistoric mining is little known, perhaps due to the small size of the veins that otherwise are widely scattered, both circumstances possibly having a strong influence on the nature of the quarrying works and their archaeological visibility. With the aim of assessing the basic characteristics, regarding both the nature and intensity of the extractive works at Las Cercas/Teso del Diablo area, we have made use of high-resolution lidar data and gis tools for obtaining a sharper image of the present surface and revealing the sheer importance of the excavations carried on in earlier times. Also, some brief remarks are made on the chronology and distribution of this commodity across Western Iberia.},
