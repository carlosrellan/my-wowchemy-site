  title = {New radiometric dates for the prehistory of northwestern iberia: {Valdavara} cave ({Becerreá}, {Lugo}) {\textbar} {Nuevas} fechas radiométricas para la prehistoria del noroeste de la península ibérica: {La} cueva de valdavara ({Becerreá}, {Lugo})},
  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to make known the first results of the excavations in Valdavara Cave (Becerreá, Lugo), paying special attention to the radiometric dating that places this cave among the few Galician sites with Upper Palaeolithic dates. During the excavation carried out in 2007, two archaeological locations were documented in the same karstic system (Valdavara 1 and Valdavara 2). The test pit initiated in Valdavara 1 allowed us to identify so far two stratigraphic units: an upper unit corresponding to Recent Prehistory and a lower unit (level 4) that yielded the Upper Palaeolithic dates. An assemblage of human remains from the Bronze Age was found in Valdavara 2.},
